# TASK-1--Data-distribution-visualization

# Overview
This project analyzes the distribution of global population across different income groups using cleaned World Bank population data for the year 2022.

# Objective
Explore the structure and characteristics of the dataset ,identify categorical and continuous variables and to visualize how population is spread among income classifications and  highlight global economic disparities using a clear and interpretable bar chart.

# Dataset Description
Source: World Bank population dataset
Year used: 2022
Key fields:
Population(2022) &  Income Group

The dataset was cleaned prior to visualization to ensure:
Removal of irrelevant aggregates
Proper handling of blank values
Consistent categorization of income groups

# Tools Used
Data Cleaning & processing - Python
Power BI – for data modeling and visualization

# Key Insights
Upper-middle and lower-middle income groups account for the largest share of the global population in 2022.
High-income groups represent a smaller portion of the world’s population despite stronger economic conditions.
Low-income and least-developed income groups contribute less to total population compared to middle-income groups.
The visualization highlights clear global economic and demographic imbalances.
Grouping countries by income level provides a more meaningful view of population distribution than analyzing individual countries alone

# Conclusion
This analysis provides a focused, single-year snapshot of global population distribution by income group.
By using a bar chart and a categorical variable, the visualization clearly communicates how population is concentrated across different economic levels in 2022.
