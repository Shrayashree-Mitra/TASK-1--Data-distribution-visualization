# TASK-1--Data-distribution-visualization
Analyzed data distributions using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and visualized patterns using Power Bi.
Population Distribution by Income Group (2022)
# Project Overview
This project analyzes the distribution of global population across different income groups using cleaned World Bank population data for the year 2022.
The objective is to visualize how population is spread among income classifications and to highlight global economic disparities using a clear and interpretable bar chart.
# Dataset Description
Source: World Bank population dataset
Year used: 2022
Key fields:
Country / Income Group
Population (2022)
The dataset was cleaned prior to visualization to ensure:
Removal of irrelevant aggregates
Proper handling of blank values
Consistent categorization of income groups
# Tools Used
Power BI – for data modeling and visualization
Data Cleaning: by Python
# Key Insights
Upper-middle and lower-middle income groups account for the largest share of the global population in 2022.
High-income groups represent a smaller portion of the world’s population despite stronger economic conditions.
Low-income and least-developed income groups contribute less to total population compared to middle-income groups.
The visualization highlights clear global economic and demographic imbalances.
Grouping countries by income level provides a more meaningful view of population distribution than analyzing individual countries alone
# Conclusion
This analysis provides a focused, single-year snapshot of global population distribution by income group.
By using a bar chart and a categorical variable, the visualization clearly communicates how population is concentrated across different economic levels in 2022.
